        <h2 class="text-center">John F Kennedy The 35th President Of The United States</h2>
        <p class="text-center">John F. Kennedy was the 35th President of the United States (1961-1963), the youngest
          man
          elected to the office. On November 22, 1963, when he was hardly past his first thousand days in office, JFK
          was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, becoming also the youngest President to die.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Of Irish descent, he was born in Brookline, Massachusetts, on May 29, 1917. Graduating
          from Harvard in 1940, he entered the Navy. In 1943, when his PT boat was rammed and sunk by a Japanese
          destroyer, Kennedy, despite grave injuries, led the survivors through perilous waters to safety.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Back from the war, he became a Democratic Congressman from the Boston area, advancing
          in
          1953 to the Senate. He married Jacqueline Bouvier on September 12, 1953. In 1955, while recuperating from a
          back operation, he wrote Profiles in Courage, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history.</p>
        <p class="text-center">In 1956 Kennedy almost gained the Democratic nomination for Vice President, and four
          years later was a first-ballot nominee for President. Millions watched his television debates with the
          Republican candidate, Richard M. Nixon. Winning by a narrow margin in the popular vote, Kennedy became the
          first Roman Catholic President.</p>
        <p class="text-center">His Inaugural Address offered the memorable injunction: “Ask not what your country can
          do
          for you–ask what you can do for your country.” As President, he set out to redeem his campaign pledge to get
          America moving again. His economic programs launched the country on its longest sustained expansion since
          World War II; before his death, he laid plans for a massive assault on persisting pockets of privation and
          poverty.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Responding to ever more urgent demands, he took vigorous action in the cause of equal
          rights, calling for new civil rights legislation. His vision of America extended to the quality of the
          national culture and the central role of the arts in a vital society.</p>
        <p class="text-center">He wished America to resume its old mission as the first nation dedicated to the
          revolution of human rights. With the Alliance for Progress and the Peace Corps, he brought American idealism
          to the aid of developing nations. But the hard reality of the Communist challenge remained.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Shortly after his inauguration, Kennedy permitted a band of Cuban exiles, already
          armed
          and trained, to invade their homeland. The attempt to overthrow the regime of Fidel Castro was a failure.
          Soon
          thereafter, the Soviet Union renewed its campaign against West Berlin. Kennedy replied by reinforcing the
          Berlin garrison and increasing the Nation’s military strength, including new efforts in outer space.
          Confronted by this reaction, Moscow, after the erection of the Berlin Wall, relaxed its pressure in central
          Europe.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Instead, the Russians now sought to install nuclear missiles in Cuba. When this was
          discovered by air reconnaissance in October 1962, Kennedy imposed a quarantine on all offensive weapons
          bound
          for Cuba. While the world trembled on the brink of nuclear war, the Russians backed down and agreed to take
          the missiles away. The American response to the Cuban crisis evidently persuaded Moscow of the futility of
          nuclear blackmail.</p>
        <p class="text-center">Kennedy now contended that both sides had a vital interest in stopping the spread of
          nuclear weapons and slowing the arms race–a contention which led to the test ban treaty of 1963. The months
          after the Cuban crisis showed significant progress toward his goal of “a world of law and free choice,
          banishing the world of war and coercion.” His administration thus saw the beginning of new hope for both the
          equal rights of Americans and the peace of the world.</p>
